# libtwitter++
libtwitter++ is a C++ Twitter client library I'm working on to replace twitcurl, which didn't quite fit my needs. libtwitter++ is intended to be object-oriented and simple to use. For technical reasons, the repository is called libtwittercpp.

It is still under active development, and gains new features as I need them. Currently, libtwitter++ can:
- Authenticate with an OAuth consumer key, consumer secret, access key, and access secret.
- Upload media.
- Send tweets. Tweets can contain media. Tweets can be responses to other tweets.
- Poll the home and mentions timelines.
- Follow and unfollow users.
- Access friends and followers lists.
